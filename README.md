**About This Project**
**Laptop Data Analysis**
This project involves the analysis of a comprehensive dataset containing information about various laptop models. The primary objective is to explore the relationships between different laptop specifications, prices, and performance metrics, providing insights that can assist consumers in making informed purchasing decisions.

**Dataset Overview**
The dataset 'laptops.csv' includes various features for each laptop, such as:

Brand: The manufacturer of the laptop.
Model: The specific model name of the laptop.
Display Size: The size of the laptop's screen in inches.
Processor: The processor model used in the laptop.
Graphics Card: The graphics processing unit installed.
Disk Space: The storage capacity, expressed in GB or TB.
Old Price: The original retail price before any discounts.
Discount Price: The price after applying discounts.
Ratings: User ratings, providing insights into customer satisfaction.

**Project Goals**
>> Data Cleaning and Preparation: Transforming and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values, converting data types, and deriving new metrics.

>> Descriptive Analysis: Using Pandas to compute averages, distributions, and relationships between laptop features and prices.

>> Visualization: Leveraging Matplotlib to create visual representations of data insights, including price distributions, average ratings by brand, and the impact of specifications on prices.

**Technologies Used**
Python: The programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python.
Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

**Getting Started**
To get started with this project, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analyses. Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using:
>> pip install pandas matplotlib
